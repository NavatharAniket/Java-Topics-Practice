/*
Q3.  Find the Last Occurrence of a Target in Sorted Array
Your Task : you have to create class name as FirstOccurence with following methods 
void setArray(int a[]): this function can accept integer array as parameter 
int findLastOccurenceIndex(int key): you have to find the last occurence of key if key present in more than one time in array

Example: 
 Array          :  int[] arr = {1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7};
 Search key :   int skey = 4;
Output: Index is  4
Note: here 4 occur three times in array so the last occurence of 4 on index 4
If search key not found in array return -1
Important point: you have to user binary search approach for solve above approach
