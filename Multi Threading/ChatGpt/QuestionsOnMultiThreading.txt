⚙️ Intermediate Level

Producer-Consumer Problem

Implement the classic problem using wait() and notify().

Banking System Simulation

Multiple threads try to withdraw from a single account balance. Synchronize it properly.

Deadlock Simulation

Create two threads that cause a deadlock. Then, fix it.

Race Condition Example

Create a shared counter and multiple threads trying to increment it without synchronization.

File Downloader Simulator

Simulate 3 threads downloading 3 parts of a file concurrently.

Dining Philosophers Problem

Simulate 5 philosophers who alternate between thinking and eating. Avoid deadlock.

Space Shooter Game

A player fires bullets. Each bullet is a thread that moves independently (as discussed earlier).

🔁 Advanced Practice

Thread Pool Implementation Using ExecutorService

Submit multiple tasks to a fixed thread pool and manage their completion.

Custom Thread Scheduler

Build a simple scheduler that runs threads in round-robin fashion.

Multithreaded Matrix Multiplication

Use threads to multiply two large matrices in parallel.

Traffic Light Simulation

Use threads to simulate a traffic light system with RED, GREEN, and YELLOW lights changing in order.

Multithreaded Chat Server

Create a simple server that handles multiple clients (each in its own thread).

🧑‍💻 Bonus Challenges

Simulate Airport Runway

Multiple planes (threads) request permission to land (use synchronized blocks to manage access to the runway).

Read/Write Lock Implementation

Create a scenario where multiple reader threads can access a resource simultaneously, but only one writer can write.

Concurrent File Search

Given a directory, use multiple threads to search for a keyword in all files.
