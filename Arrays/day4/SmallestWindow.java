/*
Q4. Smallest window in a String containing all characters of other String
Given two strings S (length m) and P (length n), the task is to find the smallest substring in S 
that contains all characters of P, including duplicates. If no such substring exists, return “-1”.
 If multiple substrings of the same length are found, return the one with the smallest starting index.
Examples: 
Input: S = “timetopractice”, P = “toc”
Output: toprac
Explanation: “toprac” is the smallest substring in which “toc” can be found.

Input: S = “zoomlazapzo”, P = “oza”
Output: apzo
Explanation: “apzo” is the smallest substring in which “oza” can be found.

Your Task: you have to create class name as SmallWindow with constructor and methods 
SmallWindow(String data): this function is used for accept string array as parameter 
String getSmallWindow(): this function can return the small window from the string.
